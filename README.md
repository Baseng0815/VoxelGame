# VoxelGame

A voxel engine similar to minecraft written from scratch using C++ and OpenGL for educational purposes.
Current features include a GUI system, an ECS-driven engine using [entt](https://github.com/skypjack/entt),
and basic terrain generation using [noise](http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/)
